\section{State Estimation using a Kalman filter}

\subsection{}
The $\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is the process noise covariance matrix, which describes the covariance of the noise associated with the process itself.  The $\mathbf{R}$ matrix is the measurement, or observation, noise, which is associated with the noise which is introduced when a measurement is made. Finally, the $\mathbf{P}$ matrix is the estimation covariance, the covariance, or uncertainty of the given estimate.
