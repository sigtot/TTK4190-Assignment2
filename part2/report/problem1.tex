\section{State Estimation using a Kalman filter}

\subsection{} % a
The $\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is the process noise covariance matrix, which describes the covariance of the noise associated with the process itself.  The $\mathbf{R}$ matrix is the measurement, or observation, noise, which is associated with the noise which is introduced when a measurement is made. Finally, the $\mathbf{P}$ matrix is the estimation covariance, the covariance, or uncertainty of the given estimate.

% dimensions
All these matrices are square. The $\mathbf{Q}$ matrix has dimension according to the estimated state vector in our kalman filter, which in thise case makes it 4-by-4. The $R$ matrix likewise corresponds to the output vector and is hence 2-by-2. The covariance matrix $\mathbf{P}$ also corresponds to the state dimension and so is 4-by-4.

\subsection{} % b
MEMS rate gyros are the standard measurement devices for roll rate and yaw rate.

\subsection{} % c
The Kalman filter is the optimal linear state estimator when the model perfectly models the real system, the noise is entirely uncorrelated and the covariance of noise. 

% Are these met?
