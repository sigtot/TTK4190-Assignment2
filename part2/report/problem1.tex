\section{State Estimation using a Kalman filter}

\subsection{} % a
The $\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is the process noise covariance matrix, which describes the covariance of the noise associated with the process itself.  The $\mathbf{R}$ matrix is the measurement, or observation, noise, which is associated with the noise which is introduced when a measurement is made. Finally, the $\mathbf{P}$ matrix is the estimation covariance, the covariance, or uncertainty of the given estimate.

\subsection{} % b
MEMS rate gyros are the standard measurement devices for roll rate and yaw rate.

% Example of a situation where white noise assumption may be problematic

\subsection{} % c
The Kalman filter is the optimal linear state estimator when the model perfectly models the real system, the noise is entirely uncorrelated and the covariance of noise. 

% Are these met?
