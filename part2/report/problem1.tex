\section{State Estimation using a Kalman filter}

\subsection{} % a
The $\mathbf{Q}$ matrix is the process noise covariance matrix, which describes the covariance of the noise associated with the process itself.  The $\mathbf{R}$ matrix is the measurement, or observation, noise, which is associated with the noise which is introduced when a measurement is made. Finally, the $\mathbf{P}$ matrix is the estimation covariance, the covariance, or uncertainty of the given estimate.

% dimensions
All these matrices are square. The $\mathbf{Q}$ matrix has dimension according to the estimated state vector in our kalman filter, which in thise case makes it 4-by-4. The $R$ matrix likewise corresponds to the output vector and is hence 2-by-2. The covariance matrix $\mathbf{P}$ also corresponds to the state dimension and so is 4-by-4.

\subsection{} % b
MEMS rate gyros are the standard measurement devices for roll rate and yaw rate. These measurements can be modelled, as from \cite[p. 125]{beard_mclain_2012}, as \eqref{eq:gyro_model}. The parameters $k$ and $\beta$ are usually found experimentally to ensure that they are accurate, as they often are dependent on influences like temperature. $\eta$ is assumed to be zero-mean Gaussian noise. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:gyro_model}
    \Upsilon_{\text{gyro}} = k_{\text{gyro}} \Omega + \beta_{\text{gyro}} + \eta_{\text{gyro}}'
\end{equation}

\subsection{} % c
The Kalman filter is the optimal linear state estimator when the model perfectly models the real system, the noise is entirely uncorrelated and the covariance of noise. 

% Are these met?
